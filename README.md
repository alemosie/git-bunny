# Git Bunny Presents: `git yeet`!

`git yeet` is here to give you that extra support
when you're on your git adventure! 

Running the command will:
- Add all changes (`git add .`)
- Show you what has been added (`git status`)
- Commit changes (`git commit -m "$message"`)
- Push to the current branch on origin (`git push origin/$branch`)

Plus, there's a cute bunny to cheer you on ♥️

_Git Bunny is a project submission to SheSharp's 2021 Hackathon._

## Setup

Run the following commands to add `git yeet` to your gitconfig:

```
chmod u+x bunny_setup.sh
./bunny_setup.sh
```

Run `git yeet help` to test the command and learn more 👍🏻

## Example

`git yeet "First commit"`
